            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Attractiveness Level Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of estimating the attractiveness level of a person from a facial image. This project encompasses several key phases, including data collection and preprocessing, facial landmark extraction, model selection, training, and evaluation. The project's potential applications span across human-computer interaction, psychological research, and marketing and advertising sectors.</p>

            <h2>Datasets</h2>
            <p>Two datasets were utilized in this project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release">SCUT-FBP5500 Database</a>: This dataset contains 5500 images labeled with beauty scores ranging from 1 to 5. It includes images of 2000 Asian females, 2000 Asian males, 750 Caucasian females, and 750 Caucasian males. The dataset's extensive labeling and variety make it a suitable choice for this project.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/fbplab/MEBeauty-database">MeBeauty Database</a>: This dataset comprises 2550 images of individuals from diverse racial backgrounds, rated by approximately 300 individuals. The beauty scores range from 1 to 10, and the dataset's diversity enhances the robustness of the model by providing a wide range of attractiveness ratings.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="methods">
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>Several machine learning techniques were employed for both regression and classification tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Classification: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT).</li>
                <li>Regression: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Decision Tree Regression (DTR), and Linear Regression (LR).</li>
                <li>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MeBeauty dataset.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Google MediaPipe was extensively used for facial landmark detection and feature extraction. MediaPipe is a cross-platform framework for building custom machine learning pipelines. It was crucial in aligning facial features during the data preprocessing phase.</p>
            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image-column">
                    <img src="results/img1.png" alt="Facial landmarks on female">
                    <p>Figure 1: Facial landmarks detected on a female face using Google MediaPipe.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-column">
                    <img src="results/img2.png" alt="Facial landmarks on male">
                    <p>Figure 2: Facial landmarks detected on a male face using Google MediaPipe.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>MediaPipe was chosen for its robustness in detecting facial landmarks accurately, which is pivotal for feature extraction and alignment. The extracted features were saved in a .csv file for subsequent use in machine learning models.</p>
            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image-column">
                    <img src="results/img3.jpg" alt="Original female face">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Various blendshape features were analyzed to understand their impact on attractiveness levels. Blendshapes are a method of defining facial expressions, which are critical in understanding subtle cues in attractiveness.</p>
            <div class="image-row">
                <div class="image-column">
                    <img src="results/img5.png" alt="Face Blendshapes - Female">
