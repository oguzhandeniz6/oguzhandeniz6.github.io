            <h2>SCUT-FBP - Classification</h2>
            <p>Classification was performed by rounding att_level values to obtain integers. The SCUT-FBP dataset scores range from 0 to 5. The results for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are shown below for both male and female subsets.</p>

                        <p>The accuracy of different models is compared. The Decision Tree and Random Forest models (both normalized and non-normalized) show the highest accuracy. The K-Nearest Neighbors model, particularly the non-normalized version, has the lowest accuracy.</p>
